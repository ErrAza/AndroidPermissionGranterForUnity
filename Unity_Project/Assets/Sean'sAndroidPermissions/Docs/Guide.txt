Quick And Easy Guide on how to make use of this plugin:

	Contents of the plugin:

	1. Documentation with regards to the plugin, and information regarding runtime permissions on Android.

	2. Source AAR.

	3. A prefabbed object named "Granter" to make it easier to use.

	4. C# scripts to help you get started.

	How-to:

	1. Import the package.

	2. Insert the prefab "Granter" into your scene.

	3. Observe the sample script attached (UnityInterface.cs) for a basic C# Unity implementation of how to go about interacting with the plugin.

	Notes:

	1. If your AndroidManifest.xml file does not specify any permissions up front, requesting a permission at runtime will yield no result and effectively do nothing. See the AndroidHelp.pdf guide on how to get started with your AndroidManifest.

	2. Runtime permissions are available to API levels 23 and above. That means Android 6.0 devices and above.

	3. I wrote this plugin as a solution to something I needed, and to which I struggled to find any real solutions without some work. This is purely in my spare time, and as I find more time, I will gladly expand functionality. But for now, I've included the most common permissions requested in a Unity Application, that is;

		- Camera
		- Contacts (Read / Write)
		- Storage (Read / Write)
		- Location (Fine / Coarse)

- Sean.
